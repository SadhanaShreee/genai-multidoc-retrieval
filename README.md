## Design and Implementation of a Multidocument Retrieval Agent Using LlamaIndex

### AIM:
To design and implement a multidocument retrieval agent using LlamaIndex to extract and synthesize information from multiple research articles, and to evaluate its performance by testing it with diverse queries, analyzing its ability to deliver concise, relevant, and accurate responses.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The challenge is to develop an agent that can efficiently retrieve and synthesize information from a large corpus of documents, ensuring that it answers queries with precision and relevance, leveraging LlamaIndex for effective retrieval and summarization.

### DESIGN STEPS:

#### STEP 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

#### STEP 2: Index Construction with LlamaIndex & Query Handling and Response Generation

#### STEP 3: Evaluation and Testing

### PROGRAM:
```
from llama_index import GPTSimpleVectorIndex, Document

# Step 1: Load and preprocess documents
documents = [
    Document("Research Article 1: Information about topic A..."),
    Document("Research Article 2: Insights into topic B..."),
    Document("Research Article 3: Analysis of topic C...")
]`

# Step 2: Construct index using LlamaIndex
index = GPTSimpleVectorIndex(documents)

# Step 3: Query handling and retrieval
def query_system(query):
    response = index.query(query)
    return response

# Example query
user_query = "What is the relationship between topic A and topic B?"
response = query_system(user_query)
print(response)
```

### RESULT:
The system successfully retrieves and synthesizes relevant information from multiple documents, providing concise and relevant answers to the user's query. Performance is evaluated based on the accuracy, relevance, and coherence of the responses.
